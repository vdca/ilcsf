# Topic of the conference

There is a growing field of research on phonetic and phonological issues of language contact and bilingualism/multilingualism, showing the influence of one language or language variety over another (henceforth LV-A and LV-B). Aspects of suprasegmental phonology have started receiving more attention, especially in prosody and intonation. See, among others, Elordieta (2003), Mennen (2004), Colantoni & Gurlekian (2004), O’Rourke (2005, 2012), Elordieta & Calleja (2005), Romera et al. (2008), Simonet (2010, 2011), Queen (2012), Robles-Puente (2012), Romera & Elordieta (2013, 2019), van Rijswijk & Muntendam (2014), Elordieta & Irurtzun (2016), Muntendam & Torreira (2016), Lai & Gooden (2018), Kozminska (2019), Baltazani et al. (2019a, 2019b), Elordieta & Romera (to appear). However, the presence of features of LV-A in LV-B is variable within the contact population. That is, speakers of LV-A may present different frequencies of occurrence of a given feature of LV-B, or, in other words, not all speakers of LV-A may adopt the feature or show its presence with the same consistency. Age, gender and educational level may play a role in such differences, but recent work reveals the importance of other social factors as well. On the one hand, the degree of contact of speakers of LV-A with speakers of LV-B. On the other, the attitudes of speakers of LV-A towards LV-B or the LV-B ethnolinguistic group. These factors may correlate with differences in the degree of presence of features of LV-B in LV-A.

For instance, Romera & Elordieta (2013) show that in the Catalan-speaking island of Majorca monolingual speakers of Iberian Spanish adopt intonational features of the variety of Spanish with influence from Catalan spoken by Majorcans. However, the presence of such features (nuclear configurations in yes/no questions) is heterogeneous among non-Majorcans. The authors show that the differences in degree of adoption of the features are related to the attitudes of non-Majorcan Spaniards towards (Majorcan) Catalan and the Majorcan ethnolinguistic group. Speakers with more positive attitudes had higher frequencies of nuclear configurations similar to those of Majorcan Catalan. In a similar fashion, it is argued in Romera & Elordieta (2019) eta Elordieta & Romera (to appear) that the variety of Spanish spoken in the Basque Country presents final contours in yes/no interrogative utterances that resemble those of Basque, but with inter-speaker differences in frequency of occurrence of such contours. On the one hand, speakers that have more contact with Basque itself or with native speakers of Basque have higher percentages of Basque-like rising-falling circumflex contours. On the other hand, those speakers with more positive attitudes towards the Basque language and the Basque ethnolinguistic group also present higher frequencies of such contours. The two factors taken together (degree of contact and attitudes) were strong predictors of the variation. As a last example, Kozminska (2019) finds different intonational behaviors in English among native Polish speakers who moved to Great Britain to study and then work. Speakers who had a more Cosmopolitan view of life and were more oriented towards the English-speaking world showed higher percentages of use of final intonational contours in declarative utterances that were closer to native British English-like contours (the fall-rise). By comparison, speakers with a stronger Polish identity had lower frequencies of such final contours.

The goal of the conference “Intonation, language contact and social factors” is to gather researchers working on phonological issues of language contact and bilingualism, with a special focus on the interaction between social factors and intonation. The languages in contact may be of any family or area in the world.
